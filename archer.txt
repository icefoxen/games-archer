Make a gravity-sim good enough to do planetary orbits pretty well.
Then add space stations with hugass mass drivers.

Use OpenGL.  You can do pretty simple graphics, I expect.  Wireframes and
Defcon-ish abstractions would be cool.

Feel free to hardwire things.


TODO:
Circular coordinates, and focus-on-object (or point) --HW style, bitches!
Mess with depth buffer, too.
Particle trails --lines?
Make things rotate!
Better graphics -color and size
Cache quadrics and make meshes in general...



NOTES:
Don't bother with momentum exchange yet.
At the moment, if two objects hit, the smaller (less massive) one just dies.


Masses and stuff:
let sun = new mass 2.0e30 (new vector 0. 0. 0.) (new vector 0. 0. 0.)
    and mercury = new mass 3.3e23 (new vector 55e9 0. 0.) (new vector 0. 47000. 0.)
    and venus = new mass 4.9e24 (new vector 108e9 0. 0.) (new vector 0. 35000. 0.)
    and earth = new mass 6.0e24 (new vector 149.0e9 0. 0.) (new vector 0. 30000. 0.)
    and mars = new mass 6.4e23 (new vector 225e9 0. 0.) (new vector 0. 23000. 0.)
    and ceres = new mass 6.0e21 (new vector 400e9 0. 0.) (new vector 0. 18000. 0.)
